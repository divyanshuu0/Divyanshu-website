	<p>A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is usually higher than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (1,000 feet) above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges.[1]

Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism,[1] which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of years.[2] Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers.[3]

High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level at similar latitude. These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction, such as mining and logging, along with recreation, such as mountain climbing and skiing.

The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,850 m (29,035 ft) above mean sea level. The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m (69,459 ft).</p>

	<p>The sea is the interconnected system of all the Earth's oceanic waters, including the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Southern and Arctic Oceans.[1] However, the word "sea" can also be used for many specific, much smaller bodies of seawater, such as the North Sea or the Red Sea. There is no sharp distinction between seas and oceans, though generally seas are smaller, and are often partly (as marginal seas or particularly as a mediterranean sea) or wholly (as inland seas) enclosed by land.[2] However, an exception to this is the Sargasso Sea which has no coastline and lies within a circular current, the North Atlantic Gyre.[3]: 90  Seas are generally larger than lakes and contain salt water, but the Sea of Galilee is a freshwater lake.[4][a] The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea states that all of the ocean is "sea".[8][9][b]</p>

	<p>Mountain climbing is one of the most adventurous sports which give an adrenaline rush like never before. People find solace and pleasure in this activity. Furthermore, it is also a great activity to rejuvenate oneself. Mountain climbing is an expedition that brings you closer to nature and helps you connect with it closely.

Furthermore, a person who decides to do mountain climbing has already accomplished and overcome his fear. It is an activity that teaches a lot about facing challenges and overcoming our fears. Moreover, it also makes us fitter both mentally and physically. It can be easily that those who have tried it have said to come out as better people through this experience.

Above all, people also take up mountain climbing to set new records or break the older ones. But, it is safe to say that most of them do it for the thrill of the experience and doing something adventurous. It does pose a lot of challenges for the person but that does not stop people from pursuing it nonetheless. This is so because the excitement and kick one gets here won’t find anywhere else.</p>
